     <h2> History and Traditional Health Benefits of Cocoa</h2>
<h4>Discovery</h4>
</section>
  <p>
    Cocoa beans have been harvested by ancient civilizations in Central and South America including the Maya and the Aztecs for thousands of years. They used the beans to produce a drink called chocolatl, but it would have been very bitter and unpleasant compared to the hot chocolate we know today.
  </p>
<h4 id = "HIST">Brief Time line</h4>
  <p id = "p1">
    Following the cocoa rage in South and Centeral America, The Spanish soon learned of the ledgendary bean. Taken back to Europe by the Spanish in the 1500s, cocoa began to spread across the continent and take on new forms. See the transformation shown in the following time line.

<h4>Cultural importance</h4>
  <p>
    Cocoa beans were very important to Central and South American ancient civilizations. The beans were even used as currency. There is also much documentation of cocoa beans in cultural imagery. These small beans were crucial to every part of traditional life including status, religion, and community.
  </p>

<h4>Medicinal benefits</h4>
  <p>
    When we think of a chocolate bar, the idea of a superfood is generally not what comes to mind. However, if stripped of all the added sugar and harmful chemicals mixed in to make the candy bar, cocoa actually has numerous medical benefits. Traditional medicinal users make herbal treatments from nearly every part of the plant.
